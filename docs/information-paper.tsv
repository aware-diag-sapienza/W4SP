Recently, a growing interest in increasing the human involvement has emerged, with the primary goal of improving the interpretability of machine learning models. Among different techniques, Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE), and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) represent the main model-agnostic approaches used while coping with the problem of interpreting how the features influence the prediction of a machine learning model. However, their limitations could complicate or even misdirect the analysis. PDP and ALE can hide heterogeneous effects (different influences for different subsets of the data). ICE and PDP can reveal heterogeneity but rely on the assumption of independence among features, producing misleading results if such an assumption is not satisfied. ALE overcomes this assumption, but it can show different estimation accuracy over the feature's domain and can be difficult to interpret. Furthermore, when dealing with the combined effect of more features, the combinatorial space to consider can be challenging to explore for all of them. In this paper, we contribute a novel Visual Analytics approach to study Partial Dependencies. It leverages sub-grouping of results of a Partial Dependence analysis conducted initially with individual features, allowing to steer the analysis to promising features combinations of higher-order (two and more), keeping at a lower level features whose influence estimation is already accurate. The proposed approach aims at finding more reliable feature influence estimates by looking at both the global level (PDP) and local level (ICE), leveraging the advantages and mitigating the drawbacks of each proposed state-of-the-art technique. The approach is constituted by a workflow and a novel visual representation, exploiting small-multiples of coordinated visualizations that visually inspected allow to understand the behavior of a Partial Dependence. The approach is demonstrated through an implemented Visual Analytics prototype, W4SP, available at https://aware-diag-sapienza.github.io/W4SP/. This papers provides two usages scenarios to show the benefits of this approach: the first scenario is based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, showing how the proposed solution supports the user in comprehending partial dependencies among features. The second scenario, based on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset, shows how the approach can support a decision making process evaluating the possible evolution of her diabetes risk by Partial Dependence analysis.
